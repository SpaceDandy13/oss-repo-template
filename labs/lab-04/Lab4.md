  Without a license, users will not have permission to use the code under copyright, which is bad for an open source project. 
  A license can make sure everyone could use and share the code safely.
  people will not join the project if it doesn't have an license.

  If a project does not have an explicit license, it follows default copyright laws. That means codes are actually owned by the person who wrote it. As a result, I do not have right to use or share the code.

  Yes, I agree with this claim. I think the main reason why Gopher was beated is that it required the payment of a licensing fee. It failed to follow open systems model, and developers stoped using it. Developers perfer Web, since it is open and free.
